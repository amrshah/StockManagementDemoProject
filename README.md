# StockManagementDemoProject
A Demo Project using Asp.NET (C#)

<h3>This is a demo of Stock Management System.</h3>
    <p>An initial set up with stock item add/edit/delete features.  Created by me (Ali Raza) solely for demonstration/architectural analysis purpose</p>
    <p>Main focus here was to layout an n-tier architecture solution with separate layers responsible for Data Access, Business Logic/Rules and Presentation.</p>

    <p>Once we have finalized the architectural pattern further development can be done as needed. Please see the features in pipeline for 
        getting an idea of what additions are going to be made.
    </p>

    <h3>More features in pipeline:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Stock movement</li>
        <li>Stock item locations with sub-locations management</li>
