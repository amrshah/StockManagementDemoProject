A Demo Project using Asp.NET (C#)

    An initial set up with stock item add/edit/delete features.  Created solely for demonstration/architectural analysis purpose
    Main focus here was to layout an n-tier architecture solution with separate layers responsible for Data Access, Business Logic/Rules and Presentation.
